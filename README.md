# AptFinder :

This application allows you to see, in the chosen area, if desired, the price per m2, the number of vacant homes, the density of the population in a certain zone, the schools or shops nearby, but also the average duration of sales or the average number of announcement for exemples.
 

# Requirements :
 
- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ou [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/)
- [Gradle 7.5.1](https://gradle.org/releases/)
- [Sonarcloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First you need to clone the code source into your local machine :
git clone git@github.com: mohamedkonate/aptfinder.git

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
